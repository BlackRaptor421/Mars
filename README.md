# Mars
Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, called the "Red Planet" due to its iron-rich soil. Smaller than Earth, with a thin CO₂ atmosphere, it has giant volcanoes, canyons, polar ice caps, and dust storms. Evidence suggests past liquid water, making it a prime target for exploration.

Mars, often called the **Red Planet**, is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. Its reddish color comes from iron oxide, or rust, on its surface. Mars is smaller than Earth, with about half its diameter and only 38% of Earth’s gravity. A human weighing 70 kg on Earth would weigh only about 26 kg on Mars.

The planet has a thin atmosphere made mostly of carbon dioxide, with traces of nitrogen and argon. Because of this, Mars cannot support liquid water on its surface for long periods, though evidence shows that rivers, lakes, and even oceans may have existed billions of years ago. Today, water mostly exists as ice at the poles and underground.

Mars is a cold world, with average surface temperatures around –63°C, though it can range from a comfortable 20°C at the equator during the day to –125°C at the poles at night. Despite its harsh climate, Mars is the most Earth-like planet in the solar system and a prime candidate for future human exploration.

The planet has incredible geological features: **Olympus Mons**, the tallest volcano in the solar system, nearly three times higher than Mount Everest; **Valles Marineris**, a canyon system stretching over 4,000 km, much larger than the Grand Canyon; and vast deserts of sand dunes shaped by powerful winds.

Mars also has two small moons, **Phobos** and **Deimos**, likely captured asteroids. They orbit close to the planet, with Phobos slowly spiraling inward and expected to eventually break apart.

For decades, Mars has been a focus of robotic missions, from NASA’s rovers *Spirit*, *Opportunity*, *Curiosity*, and *Perseverance* to orbiters from several nations. These missions aim to uncover the planet’s history, climate, geology, and the possibility of past or present microbial life.

Mars continues to inspire science fiction, research, and future plans for colonization. Many see it as humanity’s next great step beyond Earth.//8//8  1234567811328
